                                fez os personagens do seu jogo se moverem por conta própria. Vamos adicionar mais.}
                        
                        @teacher{This lesson is another opportunity to have students"act out the three main functions in Ninja World. Draw a box on the 
                                 board with @code{(make-world 0 640)} in it, labelled "world". Ask for a volunteer, and given them the @code{update-world}
                                 nametag to wear. Ask for @code{update-world}'s Contract and Purpose Statement. Go through a few iterations of having 
                                 @code{update-world} evaluate the world on the board, and each subsequent world that they update. 
                                 @management{Make sure to call them by name, i.e. "@code{(update-world (make-world 0 640))}"} (In the first example, 
                                 the student should erase the 0 and write a 10, and erase the 640 and write a 635. If they are stuck, refer them back 
                                 to the code.) Take another student, and give them the @code{big-bang} sign. They'll start the whole 
                                 animation, and will have a timer. Instruct the class to yell "tick!" every five seconds, and when they do, 
                                 @code{big-bang} will give the current world to @code{update-world}, who will then update it and replace it with the new 
                                 world. Let this go on for a few iterations, so the rest of the class can see the world structure being changed while 
                                 they count down. Finally, give the @code{draw-world} sign to another volunteer, along with the cutouts 
                                 of the dog and ruby. As before, ask for their name, domain, range. 
                                 When they are called, they will be given a @code{world} structure and will place the image of the dog and the ruby at the 
                                 appropriate spots on the board. Change the value of the world back to @code{(make-world 0 640)}. Call on @code{draw-world}
                                 a few times with different worlds, so the class can see the dog and ruby moving accross the screen. When each 
                                 volunteer has practiced, put all the functions together: On each "tick" the class makes, @code{big-bang} will call on 
                                 @code{update-world} to update the current world, and then @code{draw-world} to draw that updated world. Again, go 
                                 through a few iterations, so the class can see the world structure changing and characters moving in as a result.}}

                                 we need to actually add her into the game.

                                  (@code{dogX}, @code{rubyX}, and @code{catY}), but the updating and drawing functions will change only the dog and ruby's 
                                  positions. When @code{big-bang} starts the animation, only the @code{dogX} and @code{rubyX} will be updated. After a few 
                                  iterations, tell the volunteers that you've pressed the "up" key. If @code{draw-world} begins moving the ninja cat cutout,

                 but subtract 10 in another. How can a function behave so differently? It has multiple conditions, with a different response to each.
                 You've already seen this before, back in Bootstrap:1 - @code{cond}.
                 @code{cond} is a special function, which signals to the computer that the function will have multiple conditions: it behaves differently 
                 depending on what input(s) it gets. This is also known as a @vocab{piecewise function}.}

                                 label what changes between examples. This is the crucial step in the Design Recipe where they should discover the need 
                                 for @code{cond}.}}
                 @point{@student{Each @vocab{piecewise function} has at least one @vocab{clause}. Each clause has a Boolean question and a result. In

Instead of enumerating all the values of the original world, we can use the variable, @code{w}: 
@code[#:multi-line #t]{(define (keypress w key)
	(cond
                [(string=? key "up")  (make-world (world-dogX w)

                                               (+ (world-catY w) 10))]
                                                      
		[(string=? key "down")  (make-world (world-dogX w) 
                                                    (world-rubyX w) 
                                                 (- (world-catY w) 10))]
                [else w]))}
                 
The last clause in a conditional can be an @code{else} clause, which gets evaluated if all the previous clauses were @code{false}.}
                         @teacher{@code{else} clauses are best used as a catch-all for cases that you can’t otherwise enumerate. If you can state a precise 
                                   question for a clause, write the precise question instead of else. For example, if you have a function that does
                                   different things depending on whether some variable @code{x} is larger than @code{5}, it is better for beginners to
                                   write the two questions @code{(> x 5)} and @code{(<= x 5)} rather than have the second question be @code{else}. 
                                   Explicit questions make it easier to read and maintain programs. When you use @code{else}, someone has to read
                                   all the previous questions to know what condition else corresponds to: they can’t just skim all the questions 
                                   to find the one that matches their situation. This makes code more readable and understandable.}}

                                  Of course, keypresses can do a lot more in a videogame than just move a character up and down. By using what
                                  your learned about Boolean functions, you can add more advanced movement. Here are some ideas:
@itemlist[
          @item{@bold{Warping:} instead of having the player’s y-coordinate change by adding or subtracting, replace it with a Number to 
                 have the player suddenly appear at that location. (For example, hitting the @code{"c"} key causes your player to warp back
                 to the center of the screen, at y=240.)}
          @item{@bold{Boundary-detection:} Change the condition for moving up so that the player only moves up if @code{key} = @code{"up"} 
                 AND the player's y-coordinate is less than @code{480}. Likewise, change the condition for @code{"down"} to also check 
                 that the player's y-coordinate is greater than 0.}
          @item{@bold{Wrapping:} Add a condition (before any of the keys) that checks to see if the player’s y-coordinate is above 
                 the screen @code{(> y 480)}. If it is, have the player warp to the bottom. Add another condition so that the player 
                 warps back up to the top of the screen if it moves below the bottom.}
          @item{@bold{Challenge:} Have a character hide when the @code{"h"} key is pressed, only to re-appear when it is pressed again.}]
